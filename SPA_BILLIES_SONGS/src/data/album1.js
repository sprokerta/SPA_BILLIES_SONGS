            lyrics: `Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat, tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat, tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say (all you say) are all the same things I did
Copycat, tryna cop my manner (cop my manner)
Watch your back when you can't watch mine (can't watch mine)
Copycat, tryna cop my glamour (cop my glamour)
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat, tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat, tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine`,

            lyrics: `Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you, anymore
Hand, hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I-I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you, anymore`,

Ba, ba, da
Ba, ba, da, ba, da, da
Mmm
My boy's being sus, he was shady enough
But now he's just a shadow
My boy loves his friends like I love my split ends
And by that I mean
He cuts 'em off
(What?)
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
My boy's being sus and he don't know how to cuss
He just sounds like he's tryna be his father (who are you?)
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar
And by that I mean he said he'd change
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
My boy, my, my boy, my friends
I love, love, I, I love, love my split ends
My boy
My, my boy, my boy
(Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
(Alright dude, go trip over a knife)
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
You want me to be yours, well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
You want me to be yours, well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye`,

            lyrics: `Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I woulda slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at giving me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
Now you know, now I'm free
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Ooh, never let you back
Let you back, let you back
Never gonna let you back, let you back`,

Hey, call me back when ya get this
Or when you've got a minute
We really need to talk
Wait, you know what? Maybe just forget it
'Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked
Stay and blah, blah, blah
You just want what you can't have
No way, I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday, by the way
It's not you, it's me and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit, don't you, babe?
I'm not your party favor
Look, now I know we coulda done it better
But we can't change the weather
When the weather's come and gone
Books don't make sense if you read 'em backwards
You'll single out the wrong words
Like you mishear all my songs
You'll hear stay and blah, blah, blah
You just want what you can't have
No way, I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

Mind
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room for the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless
I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache)
(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache)
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache`,

Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Da, da-da, da-da
Da-da-da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da-da-da-da
Mm
Mm
Mm
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes

I've never fallen from quite this high

Alone with you, does that make sense?
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right so stay a sec
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
You're all I wanted
Just let me hold you like a hostage
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
And nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean
You're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Hold you like a hostage

7-4-2008, I still remember that, heaven sent a present my way
I won't forget your laugh, packing everything when you leave
You know you coming back, wanna see me down on my knees but that was made for a ring
I try to wait for the storm to calm down but that's stubborn, baby, leading to war
We droned down on each other, tryin' to even the score
We all been found guilty in the court of aorta
And I'll watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Watch your car, watch your car burn
I won't forget your laugh
Go ahead and watch my heart, watch my heart burn
You know you coming back, you know you coming back
Watch your car, watch your car burn

Tryna even the score
Go ahead and watch my heart, watch my heart burn
Found guilty in the court of aorta`,
